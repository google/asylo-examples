## Overview

### Why running in an enclave?

Enclaves are an emerging technology paradigm that protects the user application
from the operating systems. Running a user application inside an enclave
provides security protection for user data against attacks from the OS kernel or
even a user running with root privileges.

### Asylo support to run Redis

Asylo is an open source framework for developing enclave applications. Asylo
provides support for full-featured applications, such as Redis 5.0.7, to run
inside an enclave. We also provide an application-wrapper to make it easy to run
an application in an enclave without any source code changes, along with a BUILD
file that allows external sources to be built with Bazel.

## Build Redis 5.0.7 with Asylo

### Setting up the environment in Docker

Asylo provides a custom Docker image that contains all required dependencies, as
well as Asylo's custom toolchain, which is a convenient tool for compiling
enclave applications without manually installing the toolchain. To get started,
please follow
[the Docker instructions in the Asylo repository README.md](https://github.com/google/asylo/blob/master/README.md)
to setup the environment for Docker.

### Set up a workspace

#### Import Asylo and Redis

In any directory that you would like to define your project workspace, import
Asylo and Redis by creating a `WORKSPACE` file and add the following lines to
it:

```
workspace(name = "asylo_redis_example")

load("@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl", "http_archive")

# Asylo
http_archive(
    name = "com_google_asylo",
    urls = ["https://github.com/google/asylo/archive/v0.5.3.tar.gz"],
    sha256 = "012e786e9b691093b5e2c42b255986bcab1cadf9e25f9d024eab7adee25124b0",
    strip_prefix = "asylo-0.5.3",
)

# Redis
http_archive(
    name = "com_github_antirez_redis",
    build_file = "@com_google_asylo//asylo/distrib:redis.BUILD",
    urls = ["https://github.com/antirez/redis/archive/5.0.7.tar.gz"],
    sha256 = "2761422599f8969559e66797cd7f606c16e907bf82d962345a7d366c5d1278df",
    strip_prefix = "redis-5.0.7",
)

load("@com_google_asylo//asylo/bazel:asylo_deps.bzl", "asylo_deps")
asylo_deps()

load("@com_google_asylo//asylo/bazel:sgx_deps.bzl", "sgx_deps")
sgx_deps()
```

This bazel rule imports Asylo and Redis. To build Redis with Bazel, Asylo
provides the BUILD file for Redis 5.0.7, located at
`@com_google_asylo//asylo/distrib/redis.BUILD`.

#### Add .bazelrc

Next, in the same workspace, create a `.bazelrc` file by copying from
[the one in Asylo Repository](https://github.com/google/asylo/blob/master/.bazelrc)

This file specifies the toolchain and configurations used to build Asylo
targets.

#### Build target for Redis 5.0.7 in SGX Simulation mode

Asylo provides an application wrapper which makes it easy to run external user
applications in Asylo. To make use of it, create a BUILD file in your workspace,
and add the following lines to it.

```BUILD
licenses(["notice"])

load("@com_google_asylo//asylo/bazel:asylo.bzl", "cc_enclave_binary")
load("@linux_sgx//:sgx_sdk.bzl", "sgx_enclave_configuration")

sgx_enclave_configuration(
    name = "redis_enclave_configuration",
    stack_max_size = "0x400000",
    heap_max_size = "0x1000000",
)

cc_enclave_binary(
    name = "asylo_redis",
    enclave_build_config = "redis_enclave_configuration",
    deps = ["@com_github_antirez_redis//:redis_main"],
)
```

The `cc_enclave_binary` is the build rule that uses the application wrapper. By
claiming Redis as a dependency (`redis_main` is defined by our `BUILD.bazel`
file), it will wrap Redis and run it in Asylo. The default enclave memory size
is not sufficient to run Redis, so we need to also pass an
`sgx_enclave_configuration` to increase both the stack and heap size in order to
run Redis.

## Run Redis Server in SGX Simulation mode

Now we are ready to build and run Redis server. First, we load a docker
container that imports the current workspace by running the following Docker
command from the root of your project:

```
docker run -it --rm \
    -v ${PWD}:/opt/my-project \
    --tmpfs /root/.cache/bazel:exec \
    -w /opt/my-project \
    --network host \
    gcr.io/asylo-framework/asylo:buildenv-v0.5.3
```

Here `-v` maps the current workspace to the directory in Docker, and `-w` sets
the workspace in Docker. `--network host` allows Docker to expose ports, which
is not the case by default.

As the Redis build target is created, now it can be built with the following
`bazel` command from the Docker container:

```shell
bazel build --config=sgx-sim :asylo_redis
```

Specifying `--config=sgx-sim` builds Redis in SGX simulation mode.

After the target is built, run the following command to start Redis server:

```shell
./bazel-bin/asylo_redis
```

After running it you should be able to see Redis server up and messages similar
as following:

```shell
5884:M 25 Mar 2019 17:08:05.024 # Server initialized
5884:M 25 Mar 2019 17:08:05.024 * Ready to accept connections
```

## Run Redis Client

Now we can start a Redis client to connect to the server and start using it. In
a different terminal, run `redis-cli` to connect to the server.

```shell
redis-cli
```

After successfully connected to the server, now you can start playing with it by
setting/getting keys:

```shell
192.168.9.2:6379> ping
PONG
192.168.9.2:6379> set redis 5.0.7
OK
192.168.9.2:6379> get redis
"5.0.7"
```

To enable snapshotting (if it's not automatically enabled by the config file),
run from your redis client:

```shell
192.168.9.2:6379> CONFIG SET "save" "900 1"
```

These sets snapshotting after 900 seconds if there is at least 1 change to the
dataset. You can modify the config to the snapshotting rate you would like to
set.

## Run Redis in SGX Hardware Mode

The following steps show how to run enclavized Redis on SGX hardware.

NOTE: The following steps only work on real SGX hardware.

### Set up Enclave Config

Redis uses `fork()` for snapshotting. Asylo provides a secure `fork()`
implementation that uses an authenticated Diffie-Hellman key-exchange to
establish secure communication between the parent and child enclaves so that
parent's state is securely restored in a child enclave with the same identity.
This security features requires configuring an SGX local assertion authority
inside the enclave. The configuration is passed to the enclave via
`EnclaveConfig`. Asylo's `cc_enclave_binary` Bazel macro supports providing a
custom `EnclaveConfig` via the `application_enclave_config` parameter. The
following BUILD file configures the enclave with an `EnclaveConfig` that
contains an SGX local assertion authority config.

NOTE: The security features of Asylo `fork()` are absent when running in
simulation mode.

```BUILD
licenses(["notice"])

load("@com_google_asylo//asylo/bazel:asylo.bzl", "cc_enclave_binary")
load("@linux_sgx//:sgx_sdk.bzl", "sgx_enclave_configuration")

sgx_enclave_configuration(
    name = "redis_enclave_configuration",
    stack_max_size = "0x400000",
    heap_max_size = "0x1000000",
)

cc_enclave_binary(
    name = "asylo_redis",
    enclave_build_config = "redis_enclave_configuration",
    application_enclave_config = "@com_google_asylo//asylo/examples/redis:redis_enclave_config",
    deps = ["@com_github_antirez_redis//:redis_main"],
)
```

More details on security features provided by Asylo `fork()` can be found on the
[Asylo website](https://asylo.dev/docs/reference/runtime.html).

### Run Redis Server

Similar as SGX simulation case, run the following docker command from the root
of your project:

```
docker run -it --rm \
    --device=/dev/isgx \
    -v ${PWD}:/opt/my-project \
    -v /var/run/aesmd/aesm.socket:/var/run/aesmd/aesm.socket \
    --tmpfs /root/.cache/bazel:exec \
    -w /opt/my-project \
    --network host \
    gcr.io/asylo-framework/asylo:buildenv-v0.5.3
```

The SGX capabilities are propagated by the docker flags `--device=/dev/isgx` and
`-v /var/run/aesmd/aesm.socket:/var/run/aesmd/aesm.socket`. More details can be
found on the
[Asylo website](https://asylo.dev/docs/guides/sgx_release_enclaves.html).

In the container shell, build the target with the following `bazel` command:

```shell
bazel build --config=sgx :asylo_redis
```

Specifying `--config=sgx` builds Redis in SGX hardware mode.

After the target is built, run the following command to start Redis server:

```shell
./bazel-bin/asylo_redis
```

After running it you should be able to see Redis server up and messages similar
as following:

```shell
5884:M 25 Mar 2019 17:08:05.024 # Server initialized
5884:M 25 Mar 2019 17:08:05.024 * Ready to accept connections
```

### Run Redis Client

The steps to connect Redis client to a server that is running in SGX hardware
mode are exactly the same as in SGX simulation mode. Please follow the steps
above to connect to the enclavized Redis server and set/get keys.
